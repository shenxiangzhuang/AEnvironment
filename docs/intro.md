# AEnvironment

**Everything as Env** — A production-grade environment platform for Agentic Reinforcement Learning.

## What is AEnvironment?

AEnvironment (AEnv) is a unified environment platform designed for the Agentic RL era. It provides a complete solution for:

- 🎯 **Model Benchmarking**: Built-in support for popular benchmarks (TAU, SWE-bench, etc.)
- 🚀 **RL Training at Scale**: Seamless integration with RL frameworks (AReaL, VERL, SLIME)
- 🤖 **Agent Development**: Rich tooling for building and testing AI agents
- 🌐 **Agent Deployment**: Production-ready infrastructure for agent services
- 🔧 **Custom Environments**: Easy-to-use SDK for creating new environments

## Design Philosophy

### Everything as Env

AEnvironment treats everything as an environment — from simple tools to complex multi-agent systems. This unified abstraction enables:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Agent] --> B[Environment]
    B --> C[Tools]
    B --> D[Other Agents]
    B --> E[Benchmarks]
    B --> F[Real Services]
```

- **Composability**: Environments can be nested and composed
- **Interoperability**: Standard MCP protocol for tool communication
- **Scalability**: From local development to distributed clusters

### Agent as Env

A unique feature of AEnvironment is treating agents themselves as environments. This enables:

- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**: Agents can interact with other agents as environments
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Build complex agent ecosystems
- **Agent Testing**: Use agents to test other agents

## Quick Example

```python
from aenv import Environment, register_tool

# Define a tool
@register_tool
def search_code(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> list:
    """Search code in the repository."""
    return [{"file": "main.py", "line": 42, "content": "..."}]

# Use the environment
async with Environment("swe-env") as env:
    # List available tools
    tools = await env.list_tools()

    # Call a tool
    result = await env.call_tool("search_code", {"query": "bug fix"})
    print(result.content)
```
