# Roadmap

In the next phase, AEnvironment will provide richer environments for AI Agent scenarios while continuously optimizing performance and stability for large-scale environment interactions. We will focus on the following areas:

## Environment Types

- **GUI Agent Environments**: Support for browser-driven or desktop-style interactive GUI workloads.
- **Simulation Environments**: Model-based simulation environments.
- **Full-Stack Application Environments**: More comprehensive frontend and backend application development support.
- **Benchmark Support**: Support for more mainstream AI benchmarks (e.g., Gaia2).

## System Infrastructure

- **Observability**: Richer traces, metrics, and logs capabilities.
- **High-Performance Sandbox**: Higher performance sandbox solutions.
- **Environment Hub Frontend**: Frontend management interface for the environment hub.
